            MANX SHELL SYSTEM
            AZTEC C PRODOS 8 VERSION

    NOTES:  This system is no longer supported by the authors or
            publisher. It was abandoned in lieu of newer platforms.

            This release is based upon the original system disks and
            then expanded for functionality. There is no supplied source
            for the original MANX shell & compiler, but MANX supplied source
            for the libraries, ved, and a few miscellaneous files.

            There should also be source code for the enhancements. Some of
            these are from Phade software and were released as shareware.
            I have not been able to contact the author on these either.
            Many of these were enhanced by us to improve functionality.

            Source supplied by Kandi's Kreations is copyright by us, but
            released with the system for your usage as you see fit (unless
            otherwise specified in the files.)

            I assembled this environment as part of an historical archive
            project to preserve the 8-bit software of the Apple ][ computers.
            So a few caveats are in order.....

                1) we make no claims on software from Manx or Phade.
                   you use it at your own risk.

                2) you are responsible for any possible copyright violations
                   in the unlikely event the original publishers feel they
                   are being taken advantage of. I doubt this will happen
                   since there is no market for 8-bit software anymore.

                3) as a user, you are responsible for the continued growth
                   of the system as a whole. I don't know how many people
                   will still use this system but it is an excellent tool
                   for teaching/learning the C language.

            This seems like a decent compiler system but has very
            few online doc's or support. Since Aztec C (at least the
            Apple version) is no longer supported these may be hard to
            aquire. There are user supplied doc's and it is slowly being
            improved in development.

            This system is setup as a PRODOS shell environment. It supports
            environment variables, path searching, and more.

            Should Aztec crash, you may be able to recover by typing
            <CTRL>+<Y> and press enter.

            Aztec will launch P8 system programs. I haven't done much
            with this except to test. I know it will launch the LIST
            program (located in the bin subdirectory and named P8list)

            Some caveats are in order. It seems to crash or refuse to load
            large sys files. It will also launch BIN files, TXT (script) files
            as well as it's own PRG files.

            for more info see the other man files.

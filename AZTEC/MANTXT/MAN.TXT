syntax: man [filename] [subdirectory]

man is an online document utility similiar to the Un*x man command
it has the capability to list files to the screen by screenfuls.
Should the file need more than one screen to display, you will be
prompted on the bottom line with "More  <Q> <E>"

press any key except <Q> or <E> to continue paging.

<Q> quits displaying file
<E> edit current file

You should be able to execute man from any directory except the mantxt
directory. The problem comes from the text file in this directory named
man (this file). Because of the way the shell works it tries to execute
this file first which results in errors. This is not normally a problem
since you do not need to change directories to use the man function.

The man command by itself will list the files in the currently defined
mantxt path. See the file profile in the startup directory. It will also
list files in the subdirectories under the mantxt path.

To see how this works try:

man aztec               /* list subdirectory aztec */
man aztec/<filename>    /* view filename under subdirectory mantxt/aztec */
